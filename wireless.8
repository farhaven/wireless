.Sh NAME
.Nm wireless
.Nd scan for and configure wireless networks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans for and configures wireless networks on OpenBSD.
It uses
.Xr ifconfig 8
to do most of the heavy lifting and basically just interprets and applies scan results.
.Sh USAGE
Just run
.Nm
once to scan for known wireless LANs and configure the earliest network in the configuration file, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ wireless
\&... wait a bit for scanning and configuration ...
$ dhclient iwn0
.Ed
.Pp
The result of the scan is also written to the file
.Pa /tmp/nw-aps .
It contains one line for each access point with the following information:
.Pp
.D1 BSSID RSSI encrypted? known? SSID
.Pp
If necessary (see the
.Sx CONFIGURATION
section below),
.Nm
will notify
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
of the newly established connection by calling
.Pp
.D1 wpa_cli reassoc
.Sh CONFIGURATION
This is an example configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
device iwn0
verbose

open   freifunk.paderborn.net
802.1x eduroam
wpa    "home network" thisismypassword
.Ed
.Pp
There are three kinds of networks,
.Ic open ,
.Ic wpa
and
.Ic 802.1x .
All of these get an SSID as their first parameter.
.Ic wpa
gets the password as the second parameter.
SSIDs and passwords which contain spaces can be enclosed in single or double quotes.
Regular string quoting rules apply:
.Pp
.D1 wpa \[dq]Hello\e\[dq]foo\[dq] 'I\e'm a password!'
.Pp
You can include files with the
.Ic include
statement:
.Pp
.D1 include "/home/user/.wireless.conf"
.Pp
Macros can be set and used like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mypw = "foobar! 1234#$"
wpa nw1 $mypw
wpa nw2 $mypw
.Ed
.Pp
The priority of a network depends on the order of networks in the configuration file.
The earlier a network appears, the higher is its priority.
If an SSID is visible multiple times (such as in campus networks), the access point with the strongest RSSI is chosen.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the keyword
.Ic verbose
is given in the configuration file, the name of the network that is being configured will be printed to the standard error stream.
.Pp
The keyword
.Ic debug
enables behaviour that helps debugging.
Its meaning will change without prior notice, so it should not be used outside of development.
