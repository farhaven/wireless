WIRELESS(8)                 System Manager's Manual                WIRELESS(8)

NAME
     wireless - scan for and configure wireless networks

SYNOPSIS
     wireless [file]

DESCRIPTION
     wireless scans for and configures wireless networks on OpenBSD.  It uses
     ifconfig(8) to do most of the heavy lifting and basically just interprets
     and applies scan results.

USAGE
     Just run wireless once to scan for known wireless LANs and configure the
     earliest network in the configuration file, for example:

           $ wireless
           ... wait a bit for scanning and configuration ...
           $ dhclient iwn0

     The result of the scan is also written to the file /tmp/nw-aps.  It
     contains one line for each access point with the following information:

           BSSID RSSI encrypted? known? SSID

     If necessary (see the CONFIGURATION section below), wireless will notify
     wpa_supplicant(8) of the newly established connection by calling

           wpa_cli reassoc

CONFIGURATION
     This is an example configuration file:

           device iwn0
           verbose

           open   freifunk.paderborn.net
           802.1x eduroam
           wpa    "home network" thisismypassword

     There are three kinds of networks, open, wpa and 802.1x.  All of these
     get an SSID as their first parameter.  wpa gets the password as the
     second parameter.  SSIDs and passwords which contain spaces can be
     enclosed in single or double quotes.  Regular string quoting rules apply:

           wpa Hello\ foo" 'I'm a password!'

     You can include files with the include statement:

           include /home/user/.wireless.conf

     Macros can be set and used like this:

           mypw = "foobar! 1234#$"
           wpa nw1 $mypw
           wpa nw2 $mypw

     The priority of a network depends on the order of networks in the
     configuration file.  The earlier a network appears, the higher is its
     priority.  If an SSID is visible multiple times (such as in campus
     networks), the access point with the strongest RSSI is chosen.

FILES
     /etc/wireless.conf  configuration file
     /tmp/nw-aps         scan results

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the keyword verbose is given in the configuration file, the name of
     the network that is being configured will be printed to the standard
     error stream.

     The keyword debug enables behaviour that helps debugging.  Its meaning
     will change without prior notice, so it should not be used outside of
     development.
